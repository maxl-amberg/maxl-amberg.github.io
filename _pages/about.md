I am a PhD candidate in the research group "Sustainable Resource Management and Global Change" and a member of the "Policy Evaluation Lab" at the MCC ([Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/)). My research primarily focuses on the evaluation and causal analysis of key environmental and climate policy instruments in the transport and building sector. Currently, I am working on a scientific evaluation of Germany's €9-ticket, a large-scale public transport subsidy program.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics at Heidelberg University and Sciences Po in Paris. In 2022, I obtained my Master's degree in Economics from the University of Mannheim.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig, where I worked on the expansion of renewable energy in Germany. Additionally, I served as a student assistant at the Chair of Environmental Economics at Heidelberg University, focusing on the economics of common-pool resources.

Prior to starting my doctoral studies in early 2023, I worked at the MCC's research group "Economic Growth and Human Development" since 2019. Initially, I joined as an intern and later continued as a research assistant. During this time, my work involved the CO₂-price reform and the current energy price crisis in Germany, with a particular emphasis on the distributional aspects of various compensation measures and relief packages.

I hold a PhD scholarship of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes), supporting my doctoral research endeavors.
