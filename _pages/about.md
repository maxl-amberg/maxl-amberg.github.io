I am a PhD candidate in the ["Policy Evaluation Lab"](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/labs/policy-evaluation) of RD5 ["Climate Economics and Policy - MCC Berlin"](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/climate-economics-and-policy) at the [Potsdam Institute on Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/home)). My research primarily focuses on the evaluation and causal analysis of key environmental and climate policy instruments in the transport and building sector.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics at Heidelberg University and Sciences Po in Paris. In 2022, I obtained my Master's degree in Economics from the University of Mannheim.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig, where I worked on the expansion of renewable energy in Germany. Additionally, I served as a student assistant at the Chair of Environmental Economics at Heidelberg University, focusing on the economics of common-pool resources. Prior to starting my doctoral studies in early 2023, I worked in the RD5 working group "Welfare and Policy Design" from 2019 to the end of 2022. Initially, I joined as an intern and later continued as a research assistant in the Kopernikus project [ARIADNE](https://ariadneprojekt.de/). During this time, my work involved the COâ‚‚-price reform and the current energy price crisis in Germany, with a particular emphasis on the distributional aspects of various compensation measures and relief packages.

I hold a PhD scholarship of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes), supporting my doctoral research endeavors.
